# First Challange of Java SpringBoot!

The challenge below was proposed in the first week of the Compass scholarship program. Below is the order:


# Requirements

Use **Java 11, Maven**(to manage dependencies), and mysql with **root password** and **root user**. 
● The service should have an entity, dtos, a repository (for database connection), a controller , a service (which should house the logic when saving and fetching from the database)
● The connection to the database must be made using JPA and JDBC. **Hint: use an application.properties or application.yaml to be able to do this**

## Create two endpoints

● The payload sent to register a car in the database must have the following URLs: 
○ POST: /cars/post 
○ GET: /cars/get/{idChassi} 
>{
"idChassi": "123", (type:long(this should be the primary key of your table and unique) 
"name": "New fiesta", (type:String) 
"brand" : "Ford" ,(type:String, must accept only Ford, Chevrolet, BMW, Volvo) 
"color": "blue", (type:String) 
"fabricationYear": "2014/2015" (type:String) 
 }

## Rules

● Rule 1 - The “brand” field should accept **only the brands (Ford, Chevrolet, BMW, Volvo)** and in case of sending another field that is not these **4 brands**, send an **exception** and not let the request execute successfully. 
● Rule 2 - The above payload must be **registered in the database.** 
● Rule 3- When a **GET** is called, the **IdChassi** must be passed and the corresponding car saved by the **POST** in the database must be returned. 
● Rule 4- Nulls must not be saved in the database or returned in the **OUTPUT** or **ENTRY** DTOs, this validation must occur and in case of null, throw **an exception as described above. **
● Rules 5 - Projects that do not have **the correct database configuration will have a discounted grade. **
● Rule 6- The fields must be **in English like the payload above**


```
